**Exercise 1**

The DBMS can use a 2-way merge-sort algorithm that works as follows: load two pages in the buffer frames and sort them in what is called a single run; when the buffer frames are empty, load two new pages in the buffer frames, sort them in a new run and continue until all pages are sorted in runs. Then load merge two runs in a new single run and continue until it remains a single run left. 

A merge-sort algorithm produces for each step
B/2, B/2^2, B/2^3, ... , B/2^k runs and stops when B = 2^k ==&gt; k = log2(B) steps

The total cost of a 2-way merge-sort algorithm is 

2 x B x ( log2(B) + 1 )

**Exercise 2**

2.1 Yes we can use the block-nested loop, the cost of the algorithm in this case would be 

3000 + 3000 * 6000 / 100 = 183'000 page accesses

A block-nested loop algorithm would work as follow: for each chunk of M-2 pages of S, read every page of R and check the condition C = D on every tuple.

2.2 It is also possible to use a 2-pass algorithm since 

6000 + 3000 = 9000 &lt;= 101*101 = 10'201

On pass 0 we sort the two relation on the condition attribute according to one of the method we know. Then we load 100 pages from R and 1 page from S and we start to check if the tuple in S is present in R: if the answer is yes, compute the join between the two tuples, copy in the output and eliminate the tuple from S otherwise eliminate the tuple from R. When a buffer frame is empty, refill with a new page. The cost of this operation is 3(B(R) + B(S)).

**Exercise 3**

3'000'000 / 300'000 = 10 tuples per page

4 * 10 = 2 * x ==&gt; x = 20 tuples per leaf pages

Since we have a sparse index tree with alternative 2 we know that we have one index page for each data page. This implies we have 300'000 entries collected in groups of 20. Because of 67% rule 20 * 0.67% = 13.4 = 14 entries per leaf page.

300'000 / 14 = 21'429 leaf pages

Assume the fan-out F of the B+-tree to be 15 ((10 + 20)/2). This means that a selection on a particular value costs logF(B) = log15(B) = log15(21429).

Since the attribute costs has 10'000 different values there are on average 3'000'000 / 10'000 = 300 tuples with the same *cost* attribute. This means there are at most 300 / 10  + 1 = 31 contiguos pages with the same cost. Thus the total cost of a range query is

log15(21429) + 31 * 10 = 4 + 31 * 10 = 314 page accesses for a range query where 10 is the number of different values in the range.

**Exercise 4**

4.1 The schedule is not conflict-serializable since its associated precedence graph presents some cycle over T2,T3 and T1,T2,T3.

4.2 We can remove T3 and obtain an acyclic graph. So the minimum number of transactions that can be removed to make the graph acyclic is one.

4.3 We must compute the READS-FROM and FINAL-WRITE sets:

 1. READS-FROM={(4,1), (5,1)}
 2. FINAL-WRITE={W5(y), W5(v), W2(x), W3(z)}

So we need a schedule in which T1 comes after T4 and T5. T2 must come before T5 because of the write on v. T3 must come after T1 because of the write on z but before anything else because of the read on x. Since x is touched by T4 (which precedes T1) then T3 cannot be scheduled after T1 (this would mean that T3 is gonna be scheduled after T4, and this means that the READS-FROM set of S1 would present a new READS-FROM that clashes with S). So the answer is, no, the schedule is not view-serializable.

4.4 Yes the schedule is ACR since no transctions reads from a transaction that has not committed.

**Exercise 5**

w1(x)w2(y)w2(x)w1(y)

Accepted by the definition of the schedule, not 2PL (deadlock).

5.1 Prove and disprove:

w1(x)w2(y)w2(x)w1(y)w1(x) is view-serializable because 

 1. READS-FROM={}
 2. FINAL-WRITE={w1(y),w1(x)}

A view-equivalent schedule is

S'= w2(y)w2(x)w1(x)w1(y)w1(x) where S' READS-FROM and FINAL-WRITE sets are

 1. READS-FROM={}
 2. FINAL-WRITE={w1(y),w1(x)}

If the schedule does not accept transactions writing twice or more on the same element then the statement does not hold because assume a schedule composed by two transactions (*write* only) T1 and T2 with a deadlock and view-serializable. This means that exists a serial schedule S' such that the READS-FROM and FINAL-WRITE sets are equal, i.e. S'= T1 T2 or S'' = T2 T1. If a deadlock happens, then necesserialy the final write set of the schedule would be

 - FINAL-WRITE={w1(x),w2(y)} or
 - FINAL-WRITE={w2(x),w1(y)}

and neither S' nor S'' have the same FINAL-WRITE set.

5.2 Disprove:

The schedule

w1(x)w2(y)w2(x)w1(y)w3(x)w3(y)

is not 2PL due to the deadlock between T1 and T2 but it is view-serializable since the FINAL-WRITE of this schedule is

FINAL-WRITE={w3(x),w3(y)}

and we can find two view-equivalent schedules such as S'= T1 T2 T3 or S''= T2 T1 T3 with the same FINAL-WRITE set.
