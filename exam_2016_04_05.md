**Exercise 1**

100B * 10 = 1kB per tuple

5kB per page ==&gt; 5kB/1kB = 5 tuple per page.

500'000 / 5 = 100'000 total pages.

the algorithm can be done in two passes if the number of pages is:

B(R) &lt;= (F-1)*(F-1) i.e rad(B(R)) &lt;= (F-1) 

That is rad(100'000) + 1 =  F which is equal to 

F = 317 + 1 = 318 free buffer frames.

**Exercise 2**

4.1 We build the precedence graph of the schedule and see that a conflict-equivalent schedule is T2 T3 T4 T1.
We build the READS-FROM and FINAL-WRITE sets of the schedule S.

 1. READS-FROM={(2,4),(2,3)(2,1)}
 2. FINAL-WRITE={w1(x),w2(z),w2(y)}

If we swap T3 and T4 in the conflict-equivalent schedule we obtain the schedule S'=T2 T4 T3 T1. If we compute the READS-FROM and FINAL-WRITE set we can notice that the schedule is indeed view-equivalent to S, but its precedence graph is different from S. Since two conflict-equivalent schedules must have the same precedence graph, then we have just found a schedule that is view-equivalent to S but with a different precedence graph.

4.2 We simply build the precedence graph on S and check that the graph is indeed acyclic. Furthemore, the only conflict-equivalent schedule would be S'= T2 T3 T4 T1. Since the schedule is conflict-equivalent then we know that it is also view-equivalent to S.

4.3 Such schedule cannot exists because every conflict-equivalent schedule to S is also view-equivalent to S. 

4.4 The schedule is not 2PL with shared and exclusive locks because T3 needs to lock on x (second innstruction) and then release the lock so that T4 can write on x aswell, but it also need to lock on z before it releases x because of r3(z). However, before the read, another operation on z happens: T2 writes on z therefore T2 needs an exclusive locks on z so a deadlock happens because T3 cannot release x and withold z, T4 cannot lock on x and T2 cannot lock on z.

**Exercise 4**

R(A,B,C) = 900'000 tuples

480B per page, 12B per attribute.

480B/48B = 10 tuples per index page (3 attributes, 1 pointer, assuming alternative 2 and dense index).

4.1 Sorted index:

900'000/10 = 90'000 index pages (sorted).

Cost of selection: log2(90'000).

Cost of page access: 1.

Total cost: log2(90'000) + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16 page accesses.

4.2 B+ index-tree:

We take in consideration the 67% occupancy rule. 10 * 0.67 = 7 tuples per page (instead of 10).

900'000 / 7 = 128'572 pages. Suppose the fan-out of the B+ tree is 9 ((10 + 7)/2), searching for a key would cost 
log9(128'572) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 page accesses.

**Exercise 5**

B(R) = 11'250 pages.

B(S) = 15'000 pages.

We want to compute the bag intersection between R and Q.

5.1 Case 1, buffer M = 13'000 free frames. 

We can use a one-pass algorithm in which we simply load the whole relation R, we build a data structure on the tuples of R associating a counter on each tuple into the buffer frame and then we load the relation S one page at time. For each tuple of S we check if that tuple is in R. if the answer is yes and counter != 0 then we copy the tuple in the output and we decrement the counter. If counter = 0 then we remove the tuple from the buffer. When the buffer frame of S is empty we load another page of the relation. 

Total cost = 11'250 + 15'000 = 26'250 page accesses.

5.2 Case 2, buffer M = 120 free frames. We cannot use the one pass algorithm since none of the two relations fits in the buffer memory. We cannot even use the two-pass algorithm since 

26'250 = B(R) + B(S) &lt;= 119 * 119 = 14'161
